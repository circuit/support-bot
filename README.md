# Circuit QnA Bot framework

TODO:
- plugin framework for AI service (e.g. qnamaker.ai, dialogflow, etc)
- plugin framework for answer lookups (e.g. scrape from Circuit FAQ pages, or any other source to lookup answers based on an ID)
- optional learning for AI services that support returning multiple answers
